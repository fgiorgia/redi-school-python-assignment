# Online Quiz System

Create an online quiz system that allows users to take a quiz, view their scores, and review their answers. The system should have a pool of questions stored in a file. The questions should have multiple-choice answers, with only one correct answer per question.

## Requirements

1. Variables and Data Types:
    * Store user information such as name and age.
    * Store quiz data such as questions, options, and correct answers.

2. Functions:
    * Create functions to display questions, get user answers, check answers, and calculate the score.

3. Modules:
    * Utilize modules such as random to randomize the order of questions.

4. Data Structures:
    * Use lists or dictionaries to organize questions, options, and correct answers.

5. Flow Control Statements:
    * Implement conditions to check user answers against correct answers.

6. Loops:
    * Use loops to iterate through questions and options.

7. File I/O Operations:
    * Read questions from a file and, optionally, log user scores to a file.

8. Classes, Objects, Inheritance (Optional for Advanced Implementation):
    * Create a class for quizzes, a subclass for multiple-choice quizzes, and classes for questions and answers.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Correctness and completeness of the code.
* Proper usage of variables, data structures, and functions.
* Effective use of loops, conditions, and other control structures.
* Ability to read from and write to files.
* (Optional) Object-oriented implementation, utilizing classes, and inheritance.

## Deliverables

* Source code files.
* A text file containing the pool of questions and answers.
* (Optional) Documentation explaining the code and how to run the program.
