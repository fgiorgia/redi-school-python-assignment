# ReDI School Python Assignment

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains some Python exercises (functions, loops, flow control statements, etc.) and an online quiz system that allows users to take a quiz, view their scores, and review their answers. The questions should have multiple-choice answers, with only one correct answer per question.

## Assignment instruction
### Python exercises
#### Variables: 
- **Assignment Description**: In this task, students will create a simple program that prompts the user to input their name, age, and favorite color. The program should  store these inputs in separate variables and then print a sentence like "Your name is  John, you are 25 years old, and your favorite color is blue." This assignment practices variable declaration, user input, and string formatting. 
#### Functions: 
- **Assignment Description**: Students will write a function named multiply that takes two arguments and returns their product. They should test the function with various number pairs and print the results. This assignment reinforces function definition,  parameter handling, and return statements. 
#### Modules: 
- **Assignment Description**: By importing the random module, students will create a program that generates a 6-digit One-Time Password (OTP) each time it's run. This assignment demonstrates module importation and utilization of module functions.
#### Data Structures: 
- **Assignment Description**: Students will create a dictionary to hold book information (title, author, year published). They should also write functions to add a new book,  remove a book, and display all books. This assignment practices dictionary manipulation and function creation to interact with data structures. 
#### Flow Control Statements: 
• **Assignment Description**: In this task, students will create a program that prompts the user for a number and determines whether the number is even or odd. This assignment reinforces the use of if-else statements for flow control. 
#### Loops: 
• **Assignment Description**: Students are tasked with writing a program that asks the user for a number, then prints the mulAplicaAon table for that number (from 1 to  10). This assignment practices the use of loops for repeated tasks and user input handling. 


### TRY(OPTIONAL) 
#### Assignment: Online Quiz System 
Create an online quiz system that allows users to take a quiz, view their scores, and review their answers. The system should have a pool of questions stored in a file. The questions should have multiple-choice answers, with only one correct answer per question. 
#### Requirements: 
- **Variables and Data Types**:
  - Store user information such as name and age.
  - Store quiz data such as questions, options, and correct answers. 
- **Functions**: Create functions to display questions, get user answers, check answers, and calculate the score. 
- **Modules**: Utilize modules such as random to randomize the order of questions.
- **Data Structures**: Use lists or dictionaries to organize questions, options, and correct answers.
- **Flow Control Statements**: Implement conditions to check user answers against correct answers.
- **Loops**: Use loops to iterate through questions and options. 
- **File I/O Operations**: Read questions from a file and, optionally, log user scores to a file.
- **Classes, Objects, Inheritance (Optional for Advanced Implementation)**: Create a class for quizzes, a subclass for multiple-choice quizzes, and classes for questions and answers. 

#### Evaluation Criteria: 
- Correctness and completeness of the code. 
- Proper usage of variables, data structures, and functions. 
- Effective use of loops, conditions, and other control structures. 
- Ability to read from and write to files. 
- (Optional) Object-oriented implementation, utilizing classes, and inheritance.
  
#### Deliverables: 
- Source code files. 
- A text file containing the pool of questions and answers. 
- (Optional) Documentation explaining the code and how to run the program.
